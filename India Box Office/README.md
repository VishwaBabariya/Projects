ðŸ“Œ **OVERVIEW**

In this project, I analyzed the India Box Office dataset to extract insights and answer key questions. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand box office trends and performance metrics using two different technologies: MySQL and Python. By leveraging both technologies, I aim to validate my findings and compare results obtained from each approach.

ðŸ›  **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

1. MySQL: Integrating data from multiple CSV files by utilizing SQL joins to perform analysis.
2. Python: To conduct data analysis using libraries such as Pandas.

ðŸ“‚ **DATA SOURCES**

The analysis was conducted using data from four CSV files:

1. Director: Contains information about the directors of the movies.
2. Genre: Includes the genres associated with movies.
3. Language: Lists the languages in which the movies were released.
4. BoxOffice: Contains box office collection data for the movies, including information about the lead actor/actress, runtime in minutes, OTT platform, industry of the movie, IMDb rating, and the film's verdict.

ðŸ’¡ **KEY TAKEAWAYS**

By using both MySQL and Python for the same set of questions, I ensured a comprehensive and reliable analysis. This dual approach allowed me to explore the strengths and limitations of each technology when handling box office data.
